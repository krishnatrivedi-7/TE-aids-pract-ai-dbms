Here’s a **simple explanation with comments** and **easy viva theory** for your **Prim’s Algorithm (Greedy Search)** code.

## 🧾 **Code with Explanation (with Comments)**

```python
# Prim’s Algorithm to find Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

# Step 1: Take number of vertices as input
n = int(input("Enter number of vertices: "))

# Step 2: Take adjacency matrix as input (0 means no edge)
print("Enter the adjacency matrix (use 0 for no edge):")
g = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

# Step 3: Create a list to keep track of selected vertices
selected = [0]*n
selected[0] = 1   # Start from the first vertex
edges, cost = 0, 0

# Step 4: Loop until we have (n-1) edges in MST
while edges < n-1:
    m = 99999      # Set a large number as infinity
    x = y = 0       # Variables to store edge positions

    # Step 5: Check all edges from selected to unselected vertices
    for i in range(n):
        if selected[i]:
            for j in range(n):
                if not selected[j] and g[i][j]:
                    if m > g[i][j]:     # If smaller edge found
                        m = g[i][j]
                        x, y = i, j

    # Step 6: Print chosen edge and add cost
    print(f"Edge {x}-{y} cost: {g[x][y]}")
    cost += g[x][y]
    selected[y] = 1      # Mark this vertex as selected
    edges += 1           # Increase edge count

# Step 7: Print total cost of MST
print("Total cost of MST:", cost)

## 🧠 **Theory for Viva (in Simple English)**

### 🔹 **Aim:**

To implement **Prim’s Algorithm** using the **Greedy Method** to find a **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a connected graph.

---

### 🔹 **What is MST (Minimum Spanning Tree)?**

* A *spanning tree* is a subset of the graph that connects all vertices with the **minimum number of edges** and **no cycles**.
* *Minimum Spanning Tree* is the spanning tree with the **smallest total edge cost**.

---

### 🔹 **About Prim’s Algorithm:**

* It’s a **Greedy Algorithm** — meaning it always chooses the **minimum cost edge** that connects a **new vertex** to the growing tree.
* It starts from any vertex and keeps adding the **cheapest edge** that doesn’t form a cycle until all vertices are included.

---

### 🔹 **Steps of Prim’s Algorithm:**

1. Start from any vertex (here, vertex 0).
2. Find all edges that connect the selected vertex to unselected ones.
3. Choose the edge with the **smallest weight**.
4. Add the connected vertex to the MST.
5. Repeat steps 2–4 until all vertices are included.

---

### 🔹 **Time Complexity:**

* **O(V²)** for adjacency matrix implementation.

---

### 🔹 **Output Example:**

```
Enter number of vertices: 4
Enter the adjacency matrix (use 0 for no edge):
0 2 0 6
2 0 3 8
0 3 0 0
6 8 0 0
Edge 0-1 cost: 2
Edge 1-2 cost: 3
Edge 0-3 cost: 6
Total cost of MST: 11
```

---

### 🔹 **Key Points for Viva:**

* Prim’s algorithm builds the MST **step by step**.
* It uses **greedy choice** to pick the **lowest cost edge**.
* It ensures **no cycles** are formed.
* It is used in **network design** problems like laying cables or road connections.
